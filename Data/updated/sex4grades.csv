  Happy to read about the strong condemnation of #sex4grades. #sexualharassment shouldn‚Äôt be tolerated under any circumstance. I‚Äôm shocked to read that some commenters are placing the burden of proof on the girls.

  This reminds me of how persistently ignorant we men are concerning the burdens of being a woman. 

Regardless of what we think we know about what it means to be woman, we are still woefully and more often willfully ignorant.

  The settlement fees varied based on the timing and the kind of grade you wanted. If you paid before exams, it was substantially cheaper. Of course you paid higher for an A and to be honest, most folks were content to just fucking pass. #Pay4Grades #Sex4Grades #SexforGrades

  Of course, the class reps had their own cut and it was often to their discretion who's name made it to the lecturers table. One time I followed a class rep home to give him money just so I could pass a course. Times where hard. #Pay4Grades #Sex4Grades #SexforGrades

  So here's how it worked back then: In order to pass a course, especially a difficult course, you had to ""settle"" the lecturer. Lecturers often used class reps as collectors who took the moneys gathered in bulk and remitted to the lecturer

  Read some #Sex4grades tweets.
When are we going to talk about the fear that comes with saying the names of these lecturers?
(The fear of the school authority and others avenging the lecturer.)
I must add males are also threatened if they don't bring female friends for lecturers.

  This BBC‚Äôs new documentary is another avenue to filter people..... I just hope you don‚Äôt loose an arm reaching so far, to justify the act, or sympathize with the offenders on what it would do to their careers.

  In 1985, I taught Economics & Government in Anglican Grammar Sch, Ota, Ogun State.

I submitted the results of the Class to the HOD, only to notice some discrepancies in the records.
Investigation revealed #sex4grades.

Guess what?
I gave the HOD serious beating.
