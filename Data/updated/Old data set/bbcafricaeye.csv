  If BBC Africa eye covered another corruption scandal, I would be in for this. Or if an African PI covered this #sexforgrades I uld be in but for BBC to do this, I think fixing homosexuality that's all over Europe would be better. That's a greater scandal. This is no news.

1. The grade you graduate with does not decide what you will become in life. You can come out with a good grade and fail in life, and you can come out with a bad grade and succeed in life.

  Naira Marley sang ""Soapy"" you termed it a worldly song but your pastor demands sex for favours.

If Dr Boniface has Jo Soapy I'm sure he'll not be in this mess he has found himself.
