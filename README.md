# Sex4Grades BBC Project
Sex for Grades: undercover inside Nigerian and Ghanaian universities - BBC Africa Eye documentary

### Kindly see the contribution note. 
Let's work together on this project

Copied from BBC Africa

Universities in Nigeria and Ghana have been plagued by stories of sexual harassment by lecturers and professors for decades. Allegations include a wide array of abuses, from blackmailing students for sex in exchange for marks and admission to lewd comments and grooming.
 
After gathering dozens of testimonies, BBC Africa Eye sent undercover journalists posing as students inside the University of Lagos (UNILAG) and the University of Ghana to capture footage of the sexual harassment.  
 
Reporter Kiki Mordi, who knows first-hand how devastating sexual harassment can be, reveals what happens behind the closed doors of some of West Africaâ€™s most prestigious universities.


While #Sex4Grades and #BBCAfricaEyes trend on twitter, Students used Twitter as a means to share their opinions and pour out their complaints. We were able to scrape tweets with the hashtag #Sex4Grades #BBCAfricaEyes to extract people's thoughts and perform an analysis to support the cause, also Map out the location that needs more attention and Africa Institution where people are reporting similar stories/cultures of students abuse.

At the end of the project, we should be able to derive some actionable insight which includes:
- Map out the location that needs more attention
- Africa Institution where people are reporting similar stories/cultures of students abuse
- Which gender complained the most?
- Which time was most tweets or complains posted and what day was most tweets posted?
- How many cases were reported by the individual
- How many drop out of school tweets?
- Number of reported cases by friends or family
- Cases that were resolved when reported
